{"query": "Picture 1: <img>/home/z00533370/projects/datasets/LMUData/images/MMBench/452.jpg</img>\nHint: Read the text.\nThe properties of a light wave affect what we see. One property of a light wave is wavelength. Wavelength measures the distance between one crest to the next. The wavelength of light determines what color, if any, is visible to the human eye. The longest visible waves are red and the shortest visible waves are violet.\nAnother property of a light wave is amplitude. Amplitude refers to the distance between the middle of the wave and the point farthest from the center. This point is usually shown as the highest point on the wave, or the wave's crest. We perceive light waves with greater amplitude as being brighter.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions:\nA. amplitude\nB. wavelength\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "response": "B"}
