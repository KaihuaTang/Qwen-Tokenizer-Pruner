{"query": "Picture 1: <img>/home/z00533370/projects/datasets/LMUData/images/MMBench/480.jpg</img>\nHint: Read the text.\n\"Cleavage\" and \"fracture\" refer to the different ways that minerals can break. Cleavage occurs when a mineral breaks and forms flat planes or surfaces. These surfaces are smooth and often reflective. Minerals break cleanly along cleavage planes because there are weak points in the mineral's structure.\nWhen a mineral breaks by fracturing, it does not break along a smooth cleavage plane. Instead, this type of break results in surfaces that may look jagged or irregular.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions:\nA. fracture\nB. cleavage\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "response": "B"}
