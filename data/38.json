Endotherms, such as humans and other mammals, can regulate their temperatures internally. When the temperature of their surrounding environments changes, endotherms may shiver or sweat to keep their body temperatures within a normal range.\nFor ectotherms, by contrast, a change in the temperature of the surrounding environment will usually affect the animal's body temperature. Ectotherms often regulate their body temperatures by moving within their environments; for instance, a lizard will lie out in the sun to warm itself up.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions:\nA. endotherms\nB. ectotherms\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "response": "B"}
