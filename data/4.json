One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDevin was a mechanical engineer who was designing  to record temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The weather station would be used in a town where the highest recorded temperature was 40\u00ac\u221eC. Devin wanted to make sure the weather station would work even in unusually warm weather.\nSo, he set an indoor test chamber to 50\u00ac\u221eC with low moisture and no wind. He left the weather station in the chamber overnight. The next day, he checked to see if the weather station displayed accurate measurements after 24 hours at 50\u00ac\u221eC.\nFigure: a weather station.\nQuestion: Which of the following could Devin's test show?\nOptions:\nA. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00ac\u221eC\nB. how well the weather station would work when it was windy\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "response": "A. if the weather station would work when the temperature was 50\u00ac\u221eC."}
