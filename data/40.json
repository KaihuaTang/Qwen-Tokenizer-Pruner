{"query": "Picture 1: <img>/home/z00533370/projects/datasets/LMUData/images/MMBench/453.jpg</img>\nHint: Read the text.\nVolcanic eruptions are classified by their appearance and their behavior. During a Hawaiian eruption, for example, lava is ejected from the volcano in a column. These jets can last for several hours or for days. The lava that flows from this type of eruption can often travel for miles before cooling and hardening.\nA Strombolian eruption, on the other hand, occurs when lava erupts from the volcano in short-lived bursts that result in scattered sprays of lava. These bursts often resemble bright, exploding fireworks.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions:\nA. Hawaiian eruption\nB. Strombolian eruption\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "response": "B"}
