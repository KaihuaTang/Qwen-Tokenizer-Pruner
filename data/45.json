{"query": "Picture 1: <img>/home/z00533370/projects/datasets/LMUData/images/MMBench/481.jpg</img>\nHint: Read the text.\nThe shape of a lens determines how it bends light that passes through it. A concave lens, for example, is thinner in the center than it is at the edges. This results in light rays diverging, or bending away from one another, after passing through. Concave lenses are used in TV projectors to spread out light.\nA convex lens, on the other hand, is thicker in center than at the edges. As a result, light rays converge, or come together, after passing through. If you place a convex lens close enough to an object, the object will appear larger when you look through the lens, as in a microscope.\nQuestion: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions:\nA. convex lens\nB. concave lens\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "response": "B"}
