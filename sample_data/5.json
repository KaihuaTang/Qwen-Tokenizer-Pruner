Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nCarson made six batches of muffins over the course of one day. He used whole wheat flour in three of the batches and white flour in the other three batches. He divided the batter into muffin tins, using two ounces of batter per muffin. He baked the muffins in a 350\u00ac\u221eF oven for 20 minutes. After allowing the muffins to cool, Carson measured the dimensions of the muffins and calculated their volumes. He compared the volumes of the muffins made with whole wheat flour to the volumes of the muffins made with white flour.\nFigure: muffins cooling.\nQuestion: Identify the question that Carson's experiment can best answer.\nOptions:\nA. Does the type of flour used in the muffins affect the number of muffins that turn brown after 30 minutes in the oven?\nB. Do muffins made with white flour have larger volumes than muffins made with whole wheat flour?\nPlease select the correct answer from the options above. \n", "response": "B. Do muffins made with white flour have larger volumes than muffins made with whole wheat flour?"}
